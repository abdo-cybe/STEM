                          <p>The school building has one of the most bewitching architecture designs among all the Egyptian schools. With its charming classy looks the school’s design reflects the legacy it was meant to show and share with all other Egyptian schools.With 18 classrooms inside the building, each class moves between these rooms during the day to keep the students motivated and refreshed. Inside these classrooms, students are separated into 6 different groups. The groups are to work together to guarantee helping each other and understanding their curriculums without any outside help.<br><br>Although the school focuses on the refinement of the students’ STEM skills, Sports play a leading role in keeping the students in shape and motivated to keep going. The school includes a top tier volleyball court and a football yard that attract most students. The school is also covered with wide green spaces leading to a centered pergola that’s located between the school building and the students’ residence.

          <h3>Student Body</h3>
          <p>With only 450 students, by the end of the year, one may have had at least one conversation with everyone. Each student comes from a different background ranging from the big city residents to people with rural backgrounds, giving everyone an opportunity to understand other communities. Everyone has his own unique talent, encouraging the development of a collaborative, and competitive, atmosphere. Also, despite being a STEM school, the students show passion in various non-STEM fields, giving everyone a new experience to find other passions. However, the best thing about the students is that everyone is willing to share their knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Campus Life</h3>
          <p>The school is an amazing holistic experience. Diverse community, a research-based and curriculum-based hybrid education system, amazing extracurricular activities, and a dominant culture of giving back. Campus is always busy with activities, orientations, and student led courses. Most people have no more than three free hours, but they will never decline a request for help. Everyone is longing for new experiences. The main social scene could be described as a large family that is connected by the school where every member is effective and always happy for the success of others.</p>
