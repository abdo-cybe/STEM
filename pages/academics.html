              <p class="lead">The curriculum focuses on four main aspects which are: sciences, humanities, arts, and sports. Most classes provided are in STEM-based subjects such as chemistry, physics, biology, geology, pure mathematics, applied mathematics(mechanics), and technology. Students discuss the different topics of each subject in the classroom and then try to apply what they have learned in the labs with the guidance of our renowned faculty members. Regarding humanities, students take classes in languages: Arabic, English, German/French; Social Studies; Civics; and Religion. The purpose of these classes is to promote multi intellectuality and encourage students to share their ideas with their classmates. students are also required to enrol in one of three activities: Art, Library, Music to help them foster their sensational and artistic tastes.
